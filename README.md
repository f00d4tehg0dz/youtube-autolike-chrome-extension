# youtube-autolike-chrome-extension

*Update 1.0.7:
* Rebuilt the Extension from the Ground Up.
* Should no longer constantly like, if stopped below 7 seconds.
* It will auto-like between 7-10 seconds during video playback
* It no longer loops infinitely. It now detects URL changes and runs the script when needed.

This extension will click the thumbs up(like) button on the YouTube video you are currently viewing!
Perfect to give a thumbs up to someone.
